    "This dissertation aims to explore the contradictions in India’s demographic transformation, particularly in the context of marriage practices, through the lens of the Second Demographic Transition (SDT). While SDT theory posits that delayed marriage, declining fertility, and greater individual autonomy are characteristic of modernizing societies, India’s trajectory diverges from these expectations. Despite a rise in female education and delayed marriage in some urban groups, entrenched socio-cultural factors, such as familial norms and economic dependencies, will continue to drive marriage timing. Additionally, the persistence of dowry practices and the universality of marriage, despite growing gender imbalances and alternative life choices, will further complicate the application of SDT in India.",
    "This dissertation will argue that the persistence of patriarchal structures and unfavorable labor market conditions—where women face limited access to stable, well-paying jobs—create economic insecurities that drive women to prioritize marriage for financial security. Drawing on the theoretical framework of bargaining with patriarchy, this research will examine how women navigate these socio-economic and cultural pressures in making marital choices. By analyzing the intersection of labor market conditions, marriage dynamics, and gendered expectations, this dissertation will contribute to the understanding of India’s demographic transition, revealing the ongoing influence of patriarchy in shaping women’s choices within a modernizing society."
