        I am a doctoral student at the 
        <a href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/bagss/" target="__blank" className="font-bold"> Bamberg Graduate School for Social Sciences</a>, University of Bamberg. At the heart of my general research interests in demography, sociology and economics lies a more specific interest in family demography, gender inequality and economic inequality.

    <div className="py-4">
        My interest in the aforementioned areas stems largely from my training in economics as an undergraduate student at St. Xavier&apos;s College, Mumbai which honed my perception of development issues from a gendered lens, and in population studies at the International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai which inculcated in me sensitivity towards population structure analyses within the microcosm of families and individuals and equipped me with necessary skills to carry out said analyses.
