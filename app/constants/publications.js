        abstract: "This paper explores the theoretical basis and empirical evidence for understanding links between neo-liberal social policies and health inequalities. The pathways in which inequality generates population health outcomes are widely contested within health economics. Virchow’s philosophy galvanised thinking across the disciplines, with its emphasis on how political-economic ideologies, income inequality and public health spending shape the distribution of health and social problems. Using inequality in Under-Five Mortality Rate as a health outcome and per-capita NSDP, share of public health care expenditure, poverty ratio and share of private health care expenditure as indicators of neo-liberal policies based on 3-decade macro-panel dataset constructed using multiple sources and applying fixed effects regression model, we found that economic growth without poverty reduction and public health care spending raises health inequalities. The results are consistent across multiple robustness checks. We conclude that integrating understandings of neoliberalism into theorising about health inequality enriches the socio-political demographic perspective of health.",

        abstract: "Marriage remains the first step in family formation in India owing to the continued prevalence of arranged marriages However, most recent estimates suggest a gradual improvement in the mean age at marriage. Consequently, the erstwhile demands of suitable grooms are undergoing a marked shift. Drawing from Oppenheimer’s Breadwinner-Hypothesis this paper studies incongruencies in rising female age at marriage and deeply patriarchal nature of marriage and households in India. Using longitudinal data collected by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, this paper seeks to map the gender differentials in employment status and marital status. The Cox-Proportional Hazards Model reveals that employed males have a greater hazard ratio of entering into a marital-union as compared to unemployed males, while the opposite is observed in the case of females. We thus conclude that linkages between employment-status and marriage-market outcome are considerably different for males and females, thereby adversely affecting their age at marriage. ",

        abstract: "Concerns over rising economic inequality have been thrust back into the limelight in recent decades. India presents an unparalleled scenario where economic growth in the country largely is positive and also income inequality seems to be declining over time, however, income gaps between top and bottom deciles is increasing. This article attempts to explain this anomaly by delving into convergence patterns visible in the inequality trajectories of the country.",
